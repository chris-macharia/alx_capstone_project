<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Screen-Shot][product-screenshot]](https://imgur.com/a/CJAixk2)

-This is v.0.0.1 Of a Task  Manager app that was part of my ALX capstone project.<br>
-The main focus was to create a basic application that can perform CRUD operations in  DB.<br>
-While some efforts were put into UI and user experience, much room has been left for improvement to give a more aesthetic product.<br>

A few points to note:
* More emphasy went into making things work as the aesthetics can always be done later
* The Footer of the app isn't working and needs an Immediate FIX.
